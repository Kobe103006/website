I have made multiple changes to my website first off, I have changed the color of the website to a nice gold-ish color while keeping the dark green for my points and my footer. Then I have made my text font into "times new roman" before changing the text color to white and then I updated my text to be a make shift resum√©. Then I replaced my old image with a picture of me and added a second image. Then I added a temporary title to my website named "My website", then I changed up my link colors a bit.
